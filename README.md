# Civitai Recipe Finder

> üëâ [ÁÇπÂáªËøôÈáåÊü•Áúã‰∏≠ÊñáÊñáÊ°£](./README_ZH.md)

## Overview

In AI art creation, discovering the right **recipe**‚Äîthe optimal combination of models, trigger words, prompts, and generation parameters‚Äîoften matters more than tweaking individual settings.

**Civitai Recipe Finder** is a powerful set of custom nodes designed for **ComfyUI**, helping you quickly explore, reproduce, and analyze creative recipes from the Civitai community. It can even provide instant visual insights for your **local models**.

Whether you want to **reproduce trending artworks in one click** or **dig deep into community usage trends**, this toolkit offers **efficient, intuitive, and flexible** support.

---

## Key Features

* üîç **Visual Recipe Discovery**
  Instantly browse popular Civitai artworks for a given local model and reproduce their full recipe (prompts, parameters, LoRA combinations, workflows, etc.).

* ‚ö° **Instant Trigger Word Lookup**
  Extract official trigger words and metadata trigger words from any LoRA model.

* üìä **Community Trend Analysis**
  Aggregate hundreds of community images to identify the most frequent prompts, samplers, CFG scales, step counts, and more.

* üîó **Golden Combination Insights**
  Discover which LoRAs are most commonly paired with a specific model.

* üõ† **Modular & Extensible**
  Provided as a flexible node suite‚Äîlightweight for daily use, yet powerful enough for complex deep-dive workflows.

## Node Suite

Recipe Finder consists of three categories of nodes to cover different usage scenarios.

### 1. Visual Recipe Finder

#### `Civitai Recipe Gallery`

* **Purpose**: Browse community galleries for a selected local model and reproduce the full recipe in one click.
* **New Features**:

  * üöÄ **One-Click Workflow Loading** ‚Äì Safely load the original workflow of an image (with ComfyUI-Manager support, auto-opens in a new tab).
  * üíæ **Save Original File** ‚Äì Download the unmodified original image (with full workflow metadata) to your `output` folder.

| Output Port     | Type            | Description                                                         |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `image`         | `IMAGE`         | Selected community example image                                    |
| `info_md`       | `STRING`        | Unified Markdown recipe report (connect to `MarkdownPresenter`)     |
| `recipe_params` | `RECIPE_PARAMS` | Parameter pipeline (to be unpacked by `Get Parameters from Recipe`) |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **First Run Notice**
>
> * On the first run, all local model **hashes** will be calculated, which may take a while.
> * Cache is stored in `Civitai_Recipe_Finder/data`.
> * Subsequent runs only process new models.

#### `Get Parameters from Recipe`

* **Purpose**: Unpacks the `recipe_params` pipeline into individual outputs compatible with downstream nodes (e.g., `KSampler`).
* **Outputs**: `ckpt_name`, `positive_prompt`, `negative_prompt`, `seed`, `steps`, `cfg`, `sampler_name`, `scheduler`, `width`, `height`, `denoise`

---

### 2. In-Depth Model Analysis

Core node: **`Model Analyzer (Checkpoint / LoRA)`**

* **Purpose**:
  A fully integrated engine that performs **data fetching ‚Üí community statistics ‚Üí parameter analysis ‚Üí unified reporting**.
  Replaces the old `Data Fetcher` + multiple Analyzer nodes.

* **Inputs**: `model_name`, `image_limit`, `sort`, `nsfw_level`, `filter_type`, `summary_top_n`, `force_refresh`

* **Outputs**:

  * `full_report_md` ‚Äì Complete Markdown report
  * `fetch_summary` ‚Äì Fetch summary (e.g., ‚ÄúSuccessfully analyzed 100 items‚Äù)
  * `params_pipe` ‚Äì Pipeline of most common parameters (to be unpacked by `Get Parameters from Analysis`)

![Model\_DeepResearch example](./example_workflows/Model_DeepResearch.png)

#### `Get Parameters from Analysis`

* **Purpose**: Unpacks the `params_pipe` into the most common parameter set used in the community.
* **Outputs**: Same as `Get Parameters from Recipe`.

---

### 3. Lightweight Tool

#### `Lora Trigger Words`

* **Purpose**: Instantly retrieve trigger words for a given LoRA model.
* **Outputs**:

  * `metadata_triggers` ‚Äì Extracted from local metadata
  * `civitai_triggers` ‚Äì From Civitai API
  * `triggers_md` ‚Äì Comparison table in Markdown

## Installation & Usage

1. Place the project folder under `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/`, for example:

   ```bash
   ComfyUI/custom_nodes/CivitaiProject/
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
